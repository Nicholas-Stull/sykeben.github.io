### Welcome to my main GitHub Page!
I am an indipendent developer, currently in High School, who is familiar with languages such as: Batch, Python 3, HTML, CSS, and SmallBasic. I like to make DIY projects, like a Raspberry Pi media server, or even an Arduino Smart Door Lock. I have found GitHub to be a huge, important tool to developers like me. Feel free to check out some of my projects!
